# Consolidate LayerShell Documentation

## Priority: P3 | Type: Polish | Benefit: Low | Complexity: Quickfix

## Problem Description

The code reviewer identified that 140+ lines of documentation for a 3-property WlrLayershell configuration is excessive and over-engineered. The current documentation in CLAUDE.md is comprehensive but could be more focused and concise for better maintainability.

**Current Issue**: Documentation verbosity may overwhelm future developers and make key information harder to find.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Review current WlrLayershell documentation in CLAUDE.md**
2. **Consolidate to focus on essential information only**
3. **Keep implementation details but reduce verbose explanations**
4. **Maintain troubleshooting information but make it more concise**
5. **Preserve code examples but streamline surrounding text**

## File Locations

- `/home/jc/Dev/snippet-manager/CLAUDE.md` (lines 328-353)
  - "Focus Management: WlrLayershell Persistent Focus Implementation" section

## Success Criteria

- Documentation reduced to essential information only
- Key implementation details preserved
- Code examples maintained
- Benefits and rationale clearly stated but concise
- Overall readability improved

## Dependencies

None - standalone documentation improvement.

## Code Examples

**Current Documentation (Verbose)**:
```markdown
### Focus Management: WlrLayershell Persistent Focus Implementation
**Issue**: System shortcuts (like `super+p` for screenshots) were dismissing the overlay before they could execute, due to HyprlandFocusGrab being cleared by compositor events.

**Solution**: Replaced HyprlandFocusGrab with Wayland layer shell exclusive keyboard focus:
- **WlrLayershell Configuration**: `window.WlrLayershell.layer = WlrLayer.Overlay` positions above all windows including fullscreen
- **Exclusive Keyboard Focus**: `window.WlrLayershell.keyboardFocus = WlrKeyboardFocus.Exclusive` prevents system shortcuts from interrupting
- **Window Namespace**: `window.WlrLayershell.namespace = "snippet-manager"` for external tool identification

**Implementation**:
[code block]

**Benefits**:
- **Screenshot compatibility**: `super+p` and other system shortcuts work without dismissing overlay
- **Stronger focus control**: Native Wayland layer shell exclusive mode more reliable than compositor-specific focus grabs
- **Better architecture**: Eliminates complex HyprlandFocusGrab coordination logic
- **Cross-compositor compatibility**: Works with any Wayland compositor supporting layer shell protocol
```

**Proposed Consolidated Documentation**:
```markdown
### Focus Management: WlrLayershell Persistent Focus

**Problem**: System shortcuts (super+p, etc.) dismissed overlay due to HyprlandFocusGrab being cleared by compositor.

**Solution**: Use Wayland layer shell exclusive keyboard focus:
```qml
import Quickshell.Wayland
window.WlrLayershell.layer = WlrLayer.Overlay
window.WlrLayershell.keyboardFocus = WlrKeyboardFocus.Exclusive
```

**Benefits**: Screenshot compatibility, stronger focus control, cross-compositor support. Replaces complex HyprlandFocusGrab coordination with native Wayland protocol.
```

**Alternative Focused Version**:
```markdown
### Persistent Focus with WlrLayershell

Replaced HyprlandFocusGrab with Wayland layer shell exclusive keyboard focus to prevent system shortcuts from dismissing the overlay.

**Key Configuration**:
- `WlrLayer.Overlay` - positions above all windows
- `WlrKeyboardFocus.Exclusive` - prevents system shortcut interruption  
- `namespace: "snippet-manager"` - external tool identifier

**Result**: Screenshots and other shortcuts work without closing overlay.
```

## Reminder

When implementation is finished, update the filename prefix from `[ ]` to `[x]`.
