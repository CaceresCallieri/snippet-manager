# Add Focus Acquisition Verification

## Priority: P1 | Type: Fix | Benefit: High | Complexity: Low

## Problem Description

The current WlrLayershell implementation sets `keyboardFocus = WlrKeyboardFocus.Exclusive` but never verifies that exclusive keyboard focus was actually granted by the compositor. Users may experience non-functional keyboard input without any indication of the problem.

**Current Risk**: Silent failures where overlay appears functional but keyboard shortcuts don't work as expected.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Add focus verification after configuration**
2. **Implement user notification for focus acquisition failures**
3. **Add fallback behavior when exclusive focus cannot be acquired**
4. **Include focus status in debug logging**

## File Locations

- `/home/jc/Dev/snippet-manager/ui/OverlayWindow.qml` (lines 415-420)
  - `Component.onCompleted` WlrLayershell configuration block

## Success Criteria

- Focus acquisition is verified after configuration
- User receives notification if exclusive focus fails
- Debug logging includes focus acquisition status
- Graceful fallback when focus cannot be obtained
- No silent failures in focus management

## Dependencies

None - standalone improvement to existing WlrLayershell implementation.

## Code Examples

**Current Implementation (No Verification)**:
```qml
if (window.WlrLayershell != null) {
    window.WlrLayershell.keyboardFocus = WlrKeyboardFocus.Exclusive
    window.debugLog("üîß WlrLayershell configured: Overlay layer with exclusive keyboard focus")
}
```

**Proposed Implementation (With Verification)**:
```qml
if (window.WlrLayershell != null) {
    window.WlrLayershell.layer = WlrLayer.Overlay
    window.WlrLayershell.keyboardFocus = WlrKeyboardFocus.Exclusive
    window.WlrLayershell.namespace = "snippet-manager"
    
    // Verify focus acquisition worked
    Qt.callLater(function() {
        if (window.WlrLayershell.keyboardFocus === WlrKeyboardFocus.Exclusive) {
            window.debugLog("üîß WlrLayershell configured successfully with exclusive focus")
        } else {
            window.debugLog("‚ùå Exclusive keyboard focus acquisition failed")
            if (notifyUser) {
                notifyUser("Snippet Manager Warning", 
                          "Keyboard shortcuts may not work properly - compositor doesn't support exclusive focus", 
                          "normal")
            }
        }
    })
} else {
    window.debugLog("‚ö†Ô∏è WlrLayershell not available - exclusive focus may not work")
    if (notifyUser) {
        notifyUser("Snippet Manager", 
                  "Running in compatibility mode - some shortcuts may dismiss overlay", 
                  "low")
    }
}
```

## Reminder

When implementation is finished, update the filename prefix from `[ ]` to `[x]`.
