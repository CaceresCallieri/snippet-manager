# Search Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview

This TODO system implements search functionality for the QuickShell Snippet Manager using a phased approach with atomic commits and comprehensive documentation.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase-Based Development
- **Phase 1**: Core search functionality (basic filtering, keyboard navigation)
- **Phase 2**: Enhanced user experience (visual feedback, highlighting) 
- **Phase 3**: Advanced features (prefix modes, fuzzy search)

### Atomic Commit Strategy
Each task produces a single, focused commit that:
- Implements one specific functionality
- Maintains system stability
- Can be independently tested and reviewed
- Follows established code patterns

## Architecture Inspiration

Based on analysis of **QuickShell launcher implementation** at [caelestia-dots/shell](https://github.com/caelestia-dots/shell/tree/main/modules/launcher):

### Key Patterns Adopted
1. **Smart Dual Focus**: Search field keeps focus while arrows control list navigation
2. **Prefix-Based Search**: Context switching with "t:", "c:" prefixes  
3. **Real-time Filtering**: Reactive property bindings for instant updates
4. **State Management**: Clean separation between search logic and UI presentation

### Technical Foundation
- QML computed properties for reactive filtering
- TextField key event delegation to NavigationController
- Services pattern for complex algorithms (fuzzy search)
- Constants-driven configuration for maintainability

## Task Structure

### Phase 1: Basic Search (Foundation)
1. **[Low] Add Search TextField** - Core search input component
2. **[Medium] Implement Real-Time Filtering** - Connect search to results
3. **[Low] Add Keyboard Navigation** - Arrow key delegation pattern

### Phase 2: Enhanced Search (User Experience)  
4. **[Medium] Add Search Context Indicators** - Result counts and feedback
5. **[Low] Add Search Term Highlighting** - Visual search match emphasis

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Power User)
6. **[Medium] Add Prefix-Based Search Modes** - "t:" and "c:" search contexts
7. **[High] Add Fuzzy Search Support** - Intelligent typo tolerance and scoring

## Integration Points

### Existing Architecture
- **NavigationController**: Enhanced for external control and filtered arrays
- **OverlayWindow**: Extended with search UI and filtering logic
- **Constants**: Expanded with search styling and configuration

### New Components
- **FuzzySearch Service**: Scoring algorithm for intelligent search
- **Search Context Management**: Mode detection and state handling

## Success Metrics

### Functionality
- ✅ Real-time filtering responds within 50ms of keystrokes
- ✅ Keyboard navigation works seamlessly between search and results
- ✅ Visual feedback clearly indicates search state and results
- ✅ Advanced features enhance power user workflows

### Code Quality  
- ✅ Each task maintains existing patterns and conventions
- ✅ No regressions to current navigation or injection functionality
- ✅ Clean separation between search logic and presentation
- ✅ Comprehensive JSDoc documentation for new functions

## Development Workflow

1. **Implement tasks sequentially** - Each task builds on previous work
2. **Test thoroughly** - Manual testing plus integration validation  
3. **Commit atomically** - One commit per completed task
4. **Mark completion** - Update filename from `[ ]` to `[x]` when done

## Future Extensibility

This search implementation provides foundation for:
- **Tag-based search** - Adding snippet categorization
- **Usage-based ranking** - Frequently used snippets rank higher  
- **Search history** - Recent searches for quick re-access
- **Advanced keyboard shortcuts** - Vim-style navigation modes

---

**Status**: Ready for implementation
**Total Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours across all phases
**Dependencies**: None - purely additive to existing functionality
