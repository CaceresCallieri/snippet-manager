# Code Review Improvements - Phase 1 Search Feature

## Overview

This folder contains structured TODO tasks for addressing code quality improvements identified during the comprehensive code review of the Phase 1 search functionality implementation.

## Task Priority & Implementation Order

### High Priority (P1) - Immediate Impact
1. **[Fix] Remove Duplicate Enter Handlers** - Eliminates code duplication risk
2. **[Enhancement] Simplify Filtering Logic** - Improves clarity and performance

### Medium Priority (P2) - Code Quality 
3. **[Fix] Add Focus Safety Checks** - Prevents potential race conditions
4. **[Polish] Extract Inline Functions** - Improves readability and maintainability

### Low Priority (P3) - Future-Proofing
5. **[Enhancement] Add Search Input Validation** - Edge case handling
6. **[Polish] Standardize Property Naming** - Long-term maintainability

## Implementation Strategy

**Recommended Sequence:**
1. Start with P1 tasks for immediate quality wins
2. Complete P2 tasks to improve code organization
3. Address P3 tasks during future development cycles

**Dependencies:**
- Task #4 (Extract Inline Functions) depends on Task #1 (Remove Duplicate Handlers)
- Task #6 (Property Naming) works best after Task #2 (Simplify Filtering)
